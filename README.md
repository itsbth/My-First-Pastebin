My First Pastebin
=================
My First Pastebin is a simple pastebin for the
Google App Engine, running on the Webapp framework.

It uses *Pygments* for syntax-highlighting, and
*Mozilla Bespin/Skywriter* as a clientside editor.

Installation
------------
Copy `app.yaml.default` to `app.yaml`, and change the
application name.

The app should now be ready for uploading to the
App Engine, but it might still be a good idea to
test it using the dev server first.
